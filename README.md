# Advent of Code

Code repository for Elixir solutions to the problems found on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Running

Problem input can be found in `data/<year>/<day>.txt`.

Each day is added to `AdventOfCode.run_<year>`.

Tests should exist once the problem is found to make sure that refactoring the problem still gives the right solution.
